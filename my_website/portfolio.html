        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the game "105% NOT SNAKE" is to avoid obstacles while trying to go towards and collect a point. One important script that was
        essential to the game actually working was the "When Green FLag Clicked" script. It reset the score of the game and broadcasted a message towards
        almost all other sprites. For the character sprite when it recieved the message, it was placed in the middle of the screen and started to move after
        4 seconds. The character sprite also acted as a "broadcast station" broadcasting messages that stated when a player lost. Another important script 
        is the "When J key pressed". It basically acts the same as the "When Green Flag Clicked" script but instead it broadcasts a different message that 
        is recieved by the player 2 sprite. When the player 2 sprite recieved the message it basically did the same thing as the "Character" sprite 
        but at the same time as the "Character" sprite. An obstacle I ran across while coding was when I tried to add more obstacles that randomly changed
        positions. The problem was that, when the sprites called "Enemies" changed positions they would randomly end up on top of each other, basically acting
        as 1 obstacle instead of a few dozen. This made the game much more easy to get a high score in.</p>
