        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the game "105% NOT SNAKE" is to avoid obstacles while trying to go towards and collect a point. One important script that was
        essential to the game actually working was the "When Green FLag Clicked" script. It reset the score of the game and broadcasted a message towards
        almost all other sprites. For the character sprite when it recieved the message, it was placed in the middle of the screen and started to move after
        4 seconds. The character sprite also acted as a "broadcast station" broadcasting messages that stated when a player lost. Another important script 
        is the "When J key pressed". It basically acts the same as the "When Green Flag Clicked" script but instead it broadcasts a different message that 
        is recieved by the player 2 sprite. When the player 2 sprite recieved the message it basically did the same thing as the "Character" sprite 
        but at the same time as the "Character" sprite. An obstacle I ran across while coding was when I tried to add more obstacles that randomly changed
        positions. The problem was that, when the sprites called "Enemies" changed positions they would randomly end up on top of each other, basically acting
        as 1 obstacle instead of a few dozen. This made the game much more easy to get a high score in.</p>

        <a href="https://repl.it/FBhW/3"><img src="images/savage.jpg" alt="Savage the Story" height=400 width=650></a>
        <p>The story "Savage" is based around the kidnapping of your wife Ellie. You play as a middle aged man named Shaun who has to go on a mission to find her,
        or not... The creation of "Savage" was done by Eric Hong and Sam Thach. The story board was started on an online flow chart and was coded in Python. The 
        coding consisted of many functions that were made up of if, elif, and elses. The coding was organized in a section by section with comments separating them. The
        creation of "Savage" had a few difficulties where the coders did not realise that they had to use elif in the code. The exclusion of elif until the story's
        finalization was a problem where not using elif caused the else in the code to first: not work, and second: Loop over and over. During the gallery walk of our peers'
        stories there were many and many of them that were great, but a few stood out. The story "Watch Out Watch Out Watch Out" had many ironic and funny endings like falling
        down the stairs right after you defeat a pursuer. If we were to redo the project and have more time, I would personally add more endings and make the story longer.</p>
